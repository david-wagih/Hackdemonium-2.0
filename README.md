# Inspiration

Not only are we developers but human beings who go to school and universities have emotions like happiness, sadness, and influencing factors like motivation. Motivation is a key aspect in life in getting your best foot forward and succeeding in life. Goalden strives to accomplish that. Research shows that almost more than 42% of people are more committed, successful, and motivated by creating goals and another study proved that people work much better through a competing mindset. Many people during the pandemic didn't have anything to do and most people don't realize they can set themselves goals and proceed that way. Goalden is solving that problem.

## What it does

Goalden is a social media platform that strives to accomplish setting goals for people and allowing for users to compete against friends or collaborate with them. As a user, they're dedicated to a dashboard where they can view all the information they need. like their goals, progress, and friends including badges which can show that their goal completion wasn't just for naught but to show off with those badges against friends.

## How we built it

_Front-end_: Next.js, React, Typescript, Chakra UI, CSS, Framer Motion,
_Back-end_: Docker, Prisma (database), Typescript, Javascript, Axios
_Design_: Figma

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into timezone problems where the communication was really tough. We also had problems where we couldn't get work done due to activities we had to do in our regular day-to-day lives and attend school or university at the same time. We also had trouble with Docker and Prisma when saving the goals in the database and saving the login information whenever a user is logging in. It was our first time using Docker and Prisma so we were surprised ourselves at how well this worked out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were proud of many accomplishments like being able to get the courier-API notifications working and having them work consistently. Using docker and Prisma wasn't very easy but we were able to create seamless logging in and signing in. We also had success in creating a very beautiful and dynamic user-friendly web app while creating that functionality and solution to the problem.

## What we learned

We learned how to use Courier-API for the first time as well as Docker and Prisma as our main back-end
technologies. We also learned grit. Grit is something that pushed us through completing this web app. It wasn't an easy journey despite all the timezone conflicts and productivity. but we got to the endpoint and we made it here.

## What's next for Goalden

Goalden is planning to take a big step in creating a mobile app for users that won't always have access to a laptop or desktop. We also want to continue fixing bugs and refining some functionality in our web app so that users can have a much better experience than they are now. We also want to convert Goalden into a full-fledged social media app by creating a community page and adding functionality to that. We also want to start adding a betting functionality where users can take competing with friends to the next level. Integrity is also a major aspect so we want to find more solutions on how users can prove that they've accomplished that goal in a more clarifying way such as images, or videos, etc.
